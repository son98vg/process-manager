''' zeromq client example.

    Three clients are instantiated.
    Each client would generate a pair of numbers and send them to a server to be computed. 
    The computation is adding the two numbers together.
    Once the computed result is recieved from the server it would be printed to standard out. 

    Demonstrables:
        Multiple clients connecting to same server.
        Clients receiving correct response. '''
